# Workflow

1. Define the "Why" Problem & Scope

- [ ] Identify the core problem you're solving
- [ ] Define who the users are and what they need
- [ ] Write a short problem statement and success criteria

2. Map the System Conceptually (High-Level Design)

- [ ] **Use Case Diagram:** Defines interactions between users and the system
- [ ] **Context Diagram:** Shows your system as a black box with external entities
- [ ] **Data Flow Diagram (DFD):** Shows how data moves through the system
- [ ] **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):** Models the database structure
- [ ] **System Architecture Diagram:** Shows backend, frontend, APIs, databases

3. Model the Data (Database & Entities)

- [ ] Start with **conceptual models** (entities and relationships)
- [ ] Then **logical models** (table structure, keys, constraints)
- [ ] Then **physical models** (data types, indexes, normalization)

4. Define System Behavior (Flow, Logic & APIs)

- [ ] Sequence diagrams (how processes interact step-by-step)
- [ ] API design (OpenAPI/Swagger for endpoints)
- [ ] State diagrams (for UI or process logic)

5. Prototype

- [ ] Mock the UI with Figma or Framer
- [ ] Set up a backend skeletons (Nextjs)
- [ ] Test critical paths early

6. Iterate â€” Feedback and Refinement

- [ ] Get user feedback
- [ ] Update models and flows
- [ ] Improve performance, scalability, and usability
