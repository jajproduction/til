# Copy and Paste From System Buffer

I have my own configuration so I assume this won't work for you. [My TMUX config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jajproduction/dotfiles/refs/heads/master/.tmux.conf).

1. `alt + f + [` (copy mode)

2. Scroll to the start/end of the text you want to copy

3. Press `v` to start copying, move the cursor

4. Press `y` to yank the text

5. Press `alt + f + ]` to paste the text or `ctrl + shift + v` in your terminal
