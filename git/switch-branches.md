# Switch Branches

You can switch branches using the following command:

```sh
git checkout branch-name
```

Or, in newer Git versions (recommended):

```sh
git switch branch-name
```

**Example**:

If you want to switch to your new branch, run:

```sh
git switch dev/future-updates
```

If the branch doesn't exist yet, you can create and switch to it in one command:

```sh
git switch -c dev/future-updates
```
